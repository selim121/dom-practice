         <h3>Q1. What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h3>
        <p class="answer">
            Solution: DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface for webpages. It is represents
            every point for every page. DOM can change the document structure, style, and content. DOM is provide a way
            for programmers to access and manipulate every content, structure. <br>
            For example, using the DOM, we can dynamically create, add, or remove elements from web pag based on user
            input of other events. we can also change the style or content of existing elements, or respond to user
            interactions such as clicks or keystrokes.
        </p>
        <h3>Q2. How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h3>
        <p class="answer">
            We can select HTML elements using DOM by using various methods provided by the DOM. Some of the common DOM
            methods are given below:
            <br>-> 'document.getElementById()'
            <br>-> 'document.getElementByClassName()'
            <br>-> 'document.getElementsByTagName()'
            <br>-> 'document.querySelector()'
            <br>-> 'document.querySelectorAll()'

        </p>
        <h3>Q3. What is event bubble?</h3>
        <p class="answer">
            Event bubbling is the mechanism of Document Object Model (DOM) where events propagate from the child element
            to its parent. When an event is triggered on an element, it first triggers on that element and then bubbles
            up to its parent, grandparent and so on until it reaches the document object.
        </p>
        <h3>Q4. What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h3>
        <p class="answer">
            A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed when the
            other function has completed its work. Callbacks are commonly used in JavaScript for event handling, AJAX
            requests, and other asynchronous operations. They allow the code to be executed in a non-blocking manner,
            which can result in faster and more responsive applications.
